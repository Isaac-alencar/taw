              <strong>Rick Sanchez</strong>
              <p>
                Rick Sanchez, also known as Rick (C-137), is the titular main
                protagonist of the science fiction adult animated comedy series
                Rick and Morty. He is a megagenius[4] scientist whose alcoholism
                and reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his
                "daughter's" family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty.
                Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental
                health were large sources of speculation. As time has gone on,
                more has been revealed about his character, his backstory
                explaining much of his behaviour. At the same time, Rick has
                continuously committed more heinous acts[5][6], certifying him
                as the series' anti-hero, bordering on antagonist.

              <strong>Morty Smith</strong>
              <p>
                Mortimer "Morty" Smith Sr. is the titular central protagonist of
                Rick and Morty. He is the grandson of Rick and is often forced
                to tag along on his various misadventures. Morty attends Harry
                Herpson High School along with his sister, Summer.[8] At the
                beginning of the series, Morty was shown to be an incredibly
                anxious and submissive teenage boy. However, after going on many
                so-called adventures with Rick, Morty has seemingly become more
                confident and his own person[9], independent from Rick, rather
                than a mere sidekick.
